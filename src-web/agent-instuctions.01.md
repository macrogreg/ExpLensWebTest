# Agent Instructions for ExpLens Static Site

## Overall Goal

- Build a modern, visually appealing static website for ExpLens and place it in `docs/`.
- The site must work smoothly on both desktop and mobile.
- Use existing logos in `public/icons`; generate any other graphics as needed.
- All content under `docs/app/` is to be ignored and must be left unchanged.

## Design guidelines:

- Use a light, bright professional color scheme, compatible with the existing logo.
- You must, generate new images and graphics, and incorporatthem into the pages to create a professionally
  looking site with a financial analysis look & feel.

## Content guidelines:

- Use clear formulations. Do not be wordy.
- Use as many words as you need to bring a point across, but do not create long, good sounding descriptions
  that do not add useful information.

## Index Page Messaging

### A. What ExpLens Is

- ExpLens lets people analyze personal finances far beyond typical personal finance software.
- All data stays in the user's spreadsheet; users retain control and permanent access even if they stop using ExpLens.

### B. High-Level Approach

- Traditional tools usually analyze only by expense category, missing dimensions like purpose, family member, business or property deductions, and tax categories.
- Unstructured tags in other tools rarely enable conclusive analysis (pivot tables, charts, summaries).
- ExpLens downloads complete bank data into a spreadsheet and helps users start analyzing immediately.
- ExpLens uniquely:
    - Downloads years of data within seconds.
    - Includes banking metadata that pre-categorizes transactions and merchants, revealing potential credit card points and starter expense categories automatically.
    - Supports multiple analysis dimensions that are deeply integrated.
    - Lets users categorize transactions in the spreadsheet and sync them back to the cloud, so multiple spreadsheets can share and benefit from the same data.

### C. Pricing and Data Source

- ExpLens itself is free; donations are welcome (link TBD).
- ExpLens works with Lunch Money to access bank data. Data is stored securely on Lunch Money servers.
- Lunch Money requires a subscription (free trial available); long-term pricing is pay-what-you-want starting at $50/year or $10/month. See https://lunchmoney.app/pricing

### D. Further Reading Section

- Show links to the pages below, each with a 1–3 sentence summary generated from that page’s instructions.
- For now, create placeholder pages with a few visually appealing lorem ipsum paragraphs that fit the overall design.
    - Installing ExpLens
    - How ExpLens manages as many analysis categories as you want and how you can easily use that data.
    - How to connect ExpLens to Lunch Money (requires an API token).

## Visual Guidance

- Index page should feature modern graphics that capture the essence of ExpLens and its finance analysis focus.
- Ensure cohesive styling across the index and placeholder pages.
